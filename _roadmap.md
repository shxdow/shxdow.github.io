- Who am I writing for ?

  Myself and everyone who wants to better understand computers

- What goal am I helping them achieve

  Have a foundational understanding of various topics regarding engineering,
  security and math. Such foundations have to be built on theoretically sound
  basis

- Pick a major theme
- What is the first thing I have to do ?
- What are the remaining steps ?

  - Information and Compression
  - Cryptography
  - Distribuited systems
  - Game theory
  - Artificial Intelligence
  - Hardware engineering
  - Compilers
  - Blockchains
  - Memory allocators
  - Virtualization technologies
  - Computer architectures
  - Vulnerability research
  - Probability & Statistics
  - Dynamic Analysis
  - Logic, verification techniques and decision procedures
    # this first step is not
    # required for readers
    # instead of just writing
    # its better to have a
    # notebook by side
    - find a programming tool to use while learning
      - Mathematica, Matlab, Python, R, Sage (?)
      - Yes, its not open source 
        but who cares at this 
        point but it really
        looks like my best bet
    - learn propositional logic
      - Syntax ✅
      - Semantics ✅
      - Satisfiability and
        validity ✅
      - Equivalence and
        implications ✅
      - Substitution ✅
      - Normal Forms ✅
      - Decision Procedures for Satisfiability
    - learn first order logic
      - Syntax
      - Semantics
    - learn higher order logics

- What is the first thing I have to do ?
- What are the remaining steps ?
