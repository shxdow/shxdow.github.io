One of the ideas behind my never ending day dreaming, is the chance of obtaining huge amounts of
force through focused efforts in specific points.  

Consequentially, in order to approach problems, it is smart to ask whether leverages can exist and
if so, where are the leverage point. This becomes an extremely effective tool when combined with
the ability to see the world and to understand its rules allows us to identify possible
leverage points and exploit them.
