Reversing notes:
each segment starts with an hypothesis and builds from there

##Â Where does this binary start its main() ?


The function at address `0x00402b20` is main. It it is possible to infere this by the fact that the
function `entry` (found by Ghidra because every executable file format must provide the address of
the entry point in its header) calls HLT after a function call whose parameters are other functions
This is a very common pattern in ELF files (is it common for PE and MacO too ?)


## What does the main() do ?
