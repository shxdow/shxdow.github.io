**Build a blog. Build a business. Build something. Build anything.**

**I believe that one of the principles of living a life worth living is to create more than you consume.** That’s not to say if you’re a writer you should write more books than you read, because there are so many good books in the world already for you to read. It simply means spend more time building and creating something than you’re consuming everything.

**Whether you have humble goals or lofty dreams, there will always be multiple steps you have to complete to turn your goals into a reality.**

**If your goal is to build a wall then you have to focus on building it brick by brick, one at a time.** My goal is to build a blog and I’ll have to focus on building it post by post, one at a time. Decide what you want to build, figure out the steps you’ll have to do to make it and then focus on doing them one at a time.
