**No one’s perfect and everyone makes mistakes, including you and me.**

**That’s why it’s important to schedule reviews in to your project to see what has and hasn’t worked.** It’s good to remember that as your skills and experience grows, you’ll also identify areas that can be improved as well. If you’re taking over from someone else midway through a project then it’s even more important to do a review straight away.

**What do you do next?**

**If your wall isn’t as strong as you’d like it to be then fix the weak bricks and replace the broken ones, don’t knock it down.** If in six months time I find typos and broken links in my blog then I can correct or remove them, not delete the blog. Please don’t quit and throw a project away, when it can be fixed and is worth fixing.
