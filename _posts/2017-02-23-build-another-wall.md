title: Build Another Wall

**We already know at the end of a project we stop building.**

**The problem is when we don’t have another project to start then we risk losing our momentum.** If we lose momentum then we have to put in all of that effort we did once before to get started again, which is a waste of time and energy. The efficient thing to do is transfer that energy and momentum from one project to another.

**The answer: Build something else.**

**Once you’ve finished building your wall, build another wall and another and another, until building becomes habit.** Once producing content for this blog becomes habit, I can start another blog or develop another platform or write a book. Continue to create more than you consume and you won’t be disappointed.
