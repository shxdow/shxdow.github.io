**Don’t be a quitter, but be smart enough to know when to quit.**

**I’ve encouraged you to build something, to overcome obstacles, to fix it when it’s broken and most importantly not to give up.** As a society we view quitting the same way we view failure, which can make it tough to do. Even if you know you will have to invest a lot more than you’ll ever get back from the project, it can be tough.

**Are you brave enough to quit?**

**If every brick in your wall is broken or loose, be strong enough to knock it down and start again brick by brick.** If in a years time I realise my blog has used the wrong domain and design, talks about the wrong things and has no readers, then maybe I should quit and try again. Be smart enough to know when it’s the right time to quit and be brave enough to do it.
