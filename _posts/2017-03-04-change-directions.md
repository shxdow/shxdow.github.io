**Obstacles. Barriers. Dead ends. They can end your journey or they can cause you to change directions.**

**No matter what you do in life there will always be something standing in the way of you reaching your goal.** Money, knowledge, location, connections and timing, they can all influence how easy or hard it is to do what you want to do. The question is: what do you do when you’re faced with an obstacle?

**Do you quit or do you change direction?**

**You’ve already decided to build a wall, don’t be stopped by a dead end and change directions to keep on building.** I’ve already started to build a blog, if I lose interest in a topic then I can write about something else. When you reach a barrier I encourage you to change directions and find another way to reach your goal.
