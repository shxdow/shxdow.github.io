# Decision procedures

Given a formula representing a scenario, one interesting
thing is finding under which condition a formula is
satisfied (i.e. evaluates to true).

## Truth-Table reconstruction

A simple algorithm is consists in
reconstructing the entire truth table in a space-efficient,
recursive manner:

```text
```

<!--
# TODO: write the prolog recursive function

This function is recursive and its pretty straightforward:

1. It chooses one of the variable (called $$P$$) and
assignes it to a truth value

2. If the formula $$F$$ with the aforementioned substitution
equates to $$\top$$ or $$\bot$$ it returns such value
otherwise go to step $$1$$
-->

## Resolution Procedure

**TODO**

## Davis-Putnam-Logemann-Loveland algorithm (DPLL)

This algorithm is the basis of modern satisfiability
procedures, it extends the algorithm illustrated
before by adding optimizations

## Boolean constraint propagation

**TODO**
