# Differences between DNF and CNF

Satisfiability for a DNF formula can be verified in
linear time (at least one of its conjunctions
evaluates to true).

$$
(A \land B) \lor (C \land D); \text{satisfiable}
$$

Validity for a CNF formula can be verified in linear
time if and only if every conjunction is valid.
Given an atomic formula $$A$$, every disjunction
contains both $$\neg A$$ and $$A$$. (recall that
a formula is valid if and only if it is satisfiable
for every interpretation $$I$$)

$$
(\neg A \lor A) \land (\neg C \lor C); \text{ satisfiable}
$$

# Tseytin transformation

One may be interested in proving $$F$$ is satisfiable by 
analysing $$F'$$ a smaller, equisatisfiable formula. The
procedures produces formula at most a constant factor
larger than the starting one.



# Decision procedures

Given a formula representing a scenario, one interesting
thing is finding under which condition a formula is
satisfied (i.e. evaluates to true).

## Truth-Table reconstruction

A simple algorithm is consists in
reconstructing the entire truth table in a space-efficient,
recursive manner:

```text

```

<!--
# TODO: write the prolog recursive function

This function is recursive and its pretty straightforward:

1. It chooses one of the variable (called $$P$$) and
assignes it to a truth value

2. If the formula $$F$$ with the aforementioned substitution
equates to $$\top$$ or $$\bot$$ it returns such value
otherwise go to step $$1$$

## Resolution Procedure

**TODO**

## Davis-Putnam-Logemann-Loveland algorithm (DPLL)

This algorithm is the basis of modern satisfiability
procedures, it extends the algorithm illustrated
before by adding optimizations

## Boolean constraint propagation

**TODO**
