Given a formula representing a scenario one interesting
thing is finding under which condition a formula is
satisfied (aka is true). A simple algorithm is consists in
reconstructing the entire truth table in a space-efficient,
recursive manner

## Decision procedures

# TODO: write the prolog recursive function

This function is recursive and its pretty straightforward:

1. It chooses one of the variable (called $$P$$) and
assignes it to a truth value

2. If the formula $$F$$ with the aforementioned substitution
equates to $$\top$$ or $$\bot$$ it returns such value
otherwise go to step $$1$$
