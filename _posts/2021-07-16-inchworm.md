# On the inchworm theory

I long ago read an article on the inchworm theory, which is a gaussian curve 
rappresenting performance with frequency on the x axis and performance on the y axis.
Avarage performance occurs most often, sometimes we choke and some others we are flawless.
Therefore improving our best possible performance by learning new things is not sufficient:
in the same way an inchworm pulls his back part of the body forward, we have to improve 
our worst possible performance to improve. This theory can be leveraged by combining it with 
the fact that avoiding stupidity is easier than seeking brillance.
