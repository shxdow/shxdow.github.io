### A take on appreciating fiction books

I genuinely feel I should not be the person writing this article, but I wish I
was told the following earlier. Up until very recent times, I was completely
unable to bear the thought of reading fiction (except few notable
exceptions[1]). As it is often the case, its not reading per se that is
unpleasant, but rather the frustration that arises from a lack of interest or a
daunting read. This article is not geared towards people who (or whom ?) for
whatever reason have to read a book. If that is the case I fear I may not be of
much help.  
The following are things I personally happened to be doing at one
point or another that got me _started_.  

## Pick something of interest

"What should I read?" is the bilion dollar question, the one that is most asked
by readers of all levels and experience. The answer, for the most part, has
always been the same: what one is fascinated by.  
I have never realized that
fiction is not all about Young Adults or Fantasy, (which have never sparked joy
in me anyway). My interests in science and technology, naturally lead me to
[Isaac Asimov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Asimov). More specifically,
a mixture of [Person of Interest]() and some of the classes I'm currently for
my computer engineering BSc sparked a curiosity in the world of artificial
intelligence. More books I'm reading (besides every Asimov's book) are 
dystopian fiction such as [I have no mouth and I must scream]()

## Pick something short and self contained

Despite the countless reccomandations, both online and offline, I tried to
stick to books with the following hallmarks

* Less than 400/500 pages
* Clear and concise writing

Love and Peace may be a masterpiece and may also make someone shy away from
reading altogether Some examples may be: Lovecraft, Asimov, Doyle 

## Read at whim

If something isn’t fun, just close the book and find/do something else. If one
intends (aka want) to read for pleasure, so should it be: pleasureable.

## Find the time that best suits you to read

For some reasons, I’m much more
willing to read fiction books past 18:00 PM

## Commitment devices

The topic of commitment devices would be worth an article of its own, but for
the sake of the advice I’m presenting here, with that term we refer to any
system that punishes anyone who does not Services such as Beeminder and Stickk
provide the said functionality


### Notes

**[1]**
[That](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12578220-di-notte-sui-tetti-corsari-perfetti)
was the first book I was actually happy to have come across. Nevertheless, I had
to rush the last 150 pages the night before homework was due (which admittedly,
        its more than half the book)
