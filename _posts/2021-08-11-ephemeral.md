Was the "web" (from now on refered to as the "internet" for purely
stylistic matters) ever meant to be this ephemeral in the persistance of
its contents ?  Should have project Xanadu taken over ? Should it take over
now ? Anyone is familiar with the feeling of clicking one of the dearest
held links only to be met with a 404 error, assuming the web server is
running at all.

What would we gain if the internet was more reliable ?

- easier to cancel people ?
- accountability 
- reliablity
- content control/removal/revenge porn/censorship
