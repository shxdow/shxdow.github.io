This post tries to be the enstablishment of a series that aims to introduce the use of formual
methods and decision procedures in software engineering. The structure adopted strictly follows the
one used in the book "The Calculus of Computation", which is the source of most of the following
material.

# Fundamentals of computation

notes for self: What does computation have to do with logic ? 


# Propositional logic

Propositional logic is the first building block necessary to embark on the long journey of 
formal methods. As the name suggests, it handles propositions
[[It is a statement which has a truth value, meaning it can be proved to be true or false.
For a proposition to be valid, it must be possible to prove the proposition is either true or false.::lsn]] 
and are usually noted as $$P, Q, R$$.

## Syntax

Propositional logic (from now on _PL_) is made of three primitive elements:

#### Truth values

$$\top$$ (true) and $$\bot$$ (false)

#### Propositional variables

{:.serif}
> In mathematical logic, a propositional variable 
> (also called a sentential variable or sentential letter) is a variable which can either be true or false. <cite>Wikipedia</cite>

They are usually denoted as $$P, Q, R, P_1, P_2, \dots$$

#### Logical conjectives

They are respectively: “not”, “and”, "or", "implies", "if and only if"

$$\neg, \wedge, \vee, \rightarrow, \leftrightarrow $$

Except negation which is unary, all of the aforementioned operators are binary.


These logical connectives have an **arity**[[the number of aguments that it takes::rsn]].



#### Subformula

Formula $$G$$ is a _subformula_ of formula $$F$$ if it occures syntactically within $$G$$.

## Semantics

{:.serif}
> Semantics (from Ancient Greek: σημαντικός sēmantikós, "significant") is the study of meaning, reference, or truth.  <cite>Wikipedia</cite>


In order to define the semantics of PL there must be a mechanism in place for evaluating the propositional variables. An interpretation $$I$$ assigns to every propositional variable exactly one truth value.  

$$
I: \{P \rightarrow true, Q \rightarrow false \}  
$$

In the example, $$I$$ assigns $$true$$ to $$P$$ and $$false$$ to $$Q$$
Given a PL formula $$F$$ and an interpretation $$I$$, the simplest way to
compute the value (or truth value) of $$F$$ is via a *truth table*.
The readers of likely fall in categories that are very much acquainted to the
process of reading and interpreting a truth table, therefore I, as of now,
won't delve too much into it in favor of covering potentially more interesting [[By "more interesting" I mean't to say "*potentially* less known"::rsn]]
What I will specify, are a couple of things in regards to notation. These notions
will be further explored in future posts.

## Inductive definition of PL's semantics 

Truth tables, as convenient as they are a notation, are unsuitable for predicate logic (which will follow in later posts), therefore
we give now an inductive definition of PL's semantics. Doing so allows us to <insert the thing> instead of being forced to do <the other thing>.  

{:.boxit}
Inductive definitions of sets are often informally presented by giving some rules for generating elements of the set and then adding that an object is to be in the set only if it has been generated according to the rules. An equivalent formulation is to characterize the set as the smallest set closed under the rules.

We write $$I \models F$$ if $$F$$ evaluates to $$true$$ under $$I$$ and $$I \not \models F$$[[To be read as "not evaluates" ::rmn]]

if it evaluates to $$false$$.

Lets start by defining giving meaning to truth symbols

$$
I \models \top
$$

$$
I \not \models \bot
$$

Regardless of which interpretation $$I$$, $$\top$$, has a value $$true$$ and $$\bot$$ has value $$false$$.

$$
I \models P,  \text{ iif } I[P] = true
$$
