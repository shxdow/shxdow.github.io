> “You don’t try to build a wall. You don’t set out and say ‘I’m gonna build the biggest, baddest, greatest wall that has ever been built.’ You don’t start there. You say ‘I’m going to lay this brick as perfectly as a brick can be laid’ and you do this every single day, and soon you have a wall.” ~ Will Smith
