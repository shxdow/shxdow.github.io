I came across an
[article](https://securityintelligence.com/news/java-malware-becomes-a-cross-platform-threat/)
about a phishing attack that installs Java malware upon
success.  This reminded of *Wirenet*, a cross-platform
malware that made me wonder whether there was a link
between the two.  
  
This was one of the first, if not the
first committed attempt I made in applying reverse
engineering techniques to real world software (a
malware in this case). Despite a superior familiarity
with Windows internals (rootkits specifically), I
figured this would be a good chance to acquaint myself
to Linux.  
  
The analysis is pretty low level, it goes
over specific instructions and puts more emphasis was
put on the how (i.e. techniques used) rather than the
what (i.e. results obtained).

## Reconnaissance

The talbe contains some high level information about the sample


| :----:          | :----:                           |
| **MD5**         | 9a0e765eecc5433af3dc726206ecc56e |
| **Size**        | 64.4 KB                          |
| **File**        | ELF 32-bit LSB executable        |
| **Arch**        | Intel 80386                      |

One of the most important things about the binary is that function names were
not stripped, which made the entire process much more smooth

## Keylogger analysis

Wirenet, being a baking trojan, features a keylogger
among the spying functionalities, whose decompilation
process is shown below

<!-- <pre style="background-color: #f5f5f5;padding-left: 1rem;padding-right: 1rem;padding-top: 1rem !important;padding-bottom: 1rem;important;line-height: 1.1rem;font-family: 'Inconsolata', Courier, monospace;font-size: 0.9rem;margin-top: 0rem;margin-bottom: 1.8rem;"> -->
```assembly
void *cpStartKeyLogger(void *)

1	sub     esp, 0Ch
2	push    0               ; char *
3	call    ds:_XOpenDisplay
4	add     esp, 10h
5	test    eax, eax
6	mov     ebx, eax
7	jnz     short State_2
```

Line 2 - 3 call `XOpenDisplay` which establishes a connection to the X server, line 4 - 7 do error checking and jump to `loc_8055532` in case `XOpenDisplay` returns a non-zero value. Otherwise a variable called KeyLoggerState is set to 2.
As the name suggests, it represents the various states in which the keylogger can exist, it is used mostly for error handling purposes and is not of much interest.

```assembly
1	mov     KeyLoggerState, 2
2	jmp     loc_80557BA
```

Next, these instructions are executed

```assembly
1	sub     esp, 0Ch
2	lea     eax, [esp+118h+var_28]
3	push    eax             ; int *
4	lea     eax, [esp+11Ch+var_2C]
5	push    eax             ; int *
6	lea     eax, [esp+120h+var_24]
7	push    eax             ; int *
8	push    offset aXinputextensio ; "XInputExtension"
9	push    ebx             ; Display *
10	call    ds:_XQueryExtension
11	add     esp, 20h
12	test    eax, eax
13	jnz     short loc_805556F
```

Line 2 - 4 - 6 load variables addresses into eax, so that line 3 - 5 - 7 can push those values onto the stack and call `XQueryExtension`. `XQueryExtension` determines if the named extension is present. Line 11 cleans up the stack, line 12 - 13 check if `XInputExtension` was present.  
If the function fails KeyLoggerState is set to 3

```assembly
1	mov     KeyLoggerState, 3
2	jmp     loc_8
```

The following part starts off with a with a comparsion between `var_20` and `ebp`

```assembly
1	cmp     ebp, [esp+10Ch+var_20]
2	jl      short  loc_805558B
```

The image shows pretty clearly that the previous two lines are part of a loop![cmp loop](/assets/img/ida_cmp_loop.png)

<!-- In this part the malware iterates over the list of input devices connected to the system, looking for one containing either `AT` or `System keyboard`. -->
Every reverse engineer races against mental fatigue,
and it is fundamental to be able to dissect the
unimportant pieces from the relevant ones. This kind
of fatigue can be felt even when reading dense
material and as such I omitted parts I deemed as not
important to cover.

```assembly
1	push    offset aAt      ; "AT"
2	push    edx             ; haystack
3	mov     [esp+11Ch+haystack], edx
4	call    _strstr
```
This part is pretty simple, a string `AT` is passed to `_strstr` along with a variable called `haystack`, looking for the first occurence of the former in the latter. To put it simply, the call looks something like this:

```assembly
1	void _strstr (void *haystack, void *needle) {
2		return strstr(*haystack, *needle);
3	}
```

Line 5 cleans up the stack, line 6 stores the haystack in edx and line 7 checks `_strstr`'s return value. If it is zero execution jumps to `loc_80555D2` which simply ends the loop by incrementing the counter.

```assembly
5	add     esp, 10h
6	mov     edx, [esp+10Ch+haystack]
7	test    eax, eax
8	jnz     short loc_80555D0
```

```assembly
1	inc     ebp
2	add     edi, 18h
```

If an occurence is found there's another search, this time using `System keyboard` as needle.

```assembly
11	push    offset aSystemKeyboard ; "System keyboard"
12	push    edx             ; haystack
13	call    _strstr
14	add     esp, 10h
15	test    eax, eax
16	jz      short loc_80555D2
```

The interesting part of this branch is over, it is worth however mentioning that under some conditions a variable called `KeyLoggerState` is set to 4.  
<br>
Let's go up the abstraction ladder and let's ask ourselves what happens if the previous check happens to be passed.
Here lies the heart of the keylogger:

```assembly
1	push    dword ptr [esi] ; _DWORD
2	push    ebx             ; _DWORD
3	call    ds:_XOpenDevice
4	add     esp, 10h
5	test    eax, eax
6	jz      loc_80
```
As the name suggests, after finding the device rappresenting the system keyboard the malware tries to open it with `XOpenDevice` and return a `XDevice` structure which are defined as follows
```assembly
1	XDevice *XOpenDevice ( Display *display, XID device_id )
2	typedef struct {
3		XID device_id;
4		int num_classes;
5		XInputClassInfo *classes;
6	} XDevice;
```
There are two conditions two branches that set
`KeyLoggerState` to 5

The function either fails
```assembly
1	mov     KeyLoggerState, 5
```
or the field `device_id` (offset `[eax+4]`) is zero
```assembly
1	mov     edx, [eax+4]
2	test    edx, edx
3	mov     [esp+10Ch+var_FC], edx
4	jle     State_5
```

The executions continues to the next function. I won't
go over in detail to how variables are passed to the
function as it would be somewhat redundant

```assembly
1	push    esi             ; _DWORD
2	lea     eax, [esp+110h+var_48]
3	push    eax             ; _DWORD
4	push    [esp+114h+var_F4] ; _DWORD
5	mov     dword_805873C, ecx
6	push    ebx             ; _DWORD
7	call    ds:_XSelectExtensionEvent
8	add     esp, 10h
9	test    eax, eax
10	jnz     State_5
11	test    esi, esi         ; event_count
12	jz      State_5
```
`XSelectExtensionEvent` selects an extension event and
is defined as follows
```assembly
XSelectExtensionEvent ( Display *display,
                       Window w,
                       XEventClass *event_list,
                       int event_count )
```

The `KeyLoggerState` variable is now set to 0
```assembly
1	mov     KeyLoggerState, 0
2	lea     edi, [esp+10Ch+var_E4]
3	lea     esi, [esp+10Ch+v
```
At this point, we found the system keyboard device and
opened a handle to it.  All is set and the malware can
start logging keystrokes

```assembly
1	loc_80556D9:
2	push    eax
3	push    eax
4	push    edi             ; XEvent *
5	push    ebx             ; Display *
3		int type;
4	
5		/* KeyPress or KeyRelease */
6	
7		unsigned long serial;
8	
9		/* # of last request processed by server */
[...]
14	
15		Display *display;
16	
17		/* Display the event was read from */
[...]
54	} XKeyEvent;
```

After an event occures and `XNextEvent` gets executed
the following instructions fill a `XKeyEvent`
structure and pass it to `LogKey`. Line 34 jumps to
the previous code snippet (a never ending loop).

```assembly
1	mov     [esp+10Ch+var_84.type], eax
2	mov     eax, dword ptr [esp+10Ch+var_E4+4]
3	mov     [esp+10Ch+var_84.serial], eax
4	mov     eax, dword ptr [esp+10Ch+var_E4+0Ch]
5	mov     [esp+10Ch+var_84.display], eax
[...]
30	push    ebx             ; Display *
31	push    esi             ; XKeyEvent *
32	call    LogKey
33	add     esp, 10h
34	jmp     loc_80556D9
```

The `LogKey` function saves intercepted keystrokes to `/tmp/.m8.dat`.

<!-- This is what happens right after `KeyLoggerState` is set to 5
```assembly
1	push    0               ; int
2	push    ebx             ; Display *
3	call    ds:_XSync
4	mov     [esp+11Ch+var_11C], ebx ; Display *
5	call    ds:_XCloseDisplay
6	add     esp, 1
```
-->

## Closing Words

At a high level, the keylogger works as follows:

* Tries to connect to the X server
* Looks for the device representing the keyboard
* Sets a call back function that upon execution logs to a file intercepted keys

The implementation of the keylogger is quite simple and lean, making it easy replicate it at the cost of its ability to conceal itself, which is completly absent.
