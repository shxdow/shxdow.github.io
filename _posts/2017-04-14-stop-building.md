**A project must have a beginning and an end, otherwise it isn’t a project.**

**Once you’ve reached the end of a project, it can be very easy to want to keep on going and do more.** We do this not because we have to and not because the project needs it; we do it because we want to keep hold of that feeling of satisfaction and accomplishment. Adding a few more bells and whistles is not the same as adding more value.

**Stop.**

**If you’ve built your wall as long and as high as you need it to be, stop building.** If the design of my blog meets my needs then I need to stop tinkering and concentrate on producing content. Recognise when you've reached your goal and stop, before you go too far and wreck the work you've already done.
