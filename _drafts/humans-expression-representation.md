## Introduction

While taking my electrical engineering class the professor struck me
with something that may be one of the most profound things that
anyone ever told me. During that class he was talking about bipoles.
Bipoles are, if I understood correctly, are a mathematical model used to
represent an electrical interaction. They are a sort of black-box that
exposes two pins and only gives us information about the relationship
between current and voltage.
But why ? What is the point of describing the aforementioned interaction ?
Why would anyone want to do
it ? It turns out engineers _have_ to take decisions. These decisions 
are aimed at achieving some sort of goal, be it creating a system,
optimizing an existing one or enforcing some sort of behaviour. It follows
that if they want to achieve their goals, they need to understand the system
at hand. Althought hands on experience with an existing version of the system
would yield the highest amount of information, it is often impractical to build
a fully fledged prototype just for the sake of experimenting, its downright
stupid not to know any better. I'm by no means implying there is no good
with direct experience, its just that such care/costs/attention should only
be devoted to ideas that are better than dead ends.
This is where sciences come in: they are used to make sense of things without
living them directly.

Here is where he ended, and here is where I feel I started.
