This page is a long winded stream of thoughts, that will likely be left unfinished. It is titled
"lessons learned in engineering", although many things prescind engineering or any specific discipline.
Its mostly stuff I happened to figure out, I wish I had known or I did know before experiencing it
first hand. You name it, I have it.
Is this a letter to oneself, you may ask ? Not really. I'm afraid of the turn things could have taken
if I had foreseen the future.

# On engineering, having 'skin in the game' and life advice

Really, what is engineering at its core ? What does it feel to study engineering ?
These are some of the questions I had before enrolling in this fun ride and don't
get me wrong there have been multitude of attempts to tell me what it would have
been like, alas (?) mostly to warn me about its difficulty. I half way wish they
weren't there. That was by far the time in which I was most crippled by the
dissonance between what people _thought_ it was and what I thought something would be.
Spoiler alert: the only thing in which I was wrong was the extent to which 
I was right. The lesson I really learned is: there is no upper bound to 
how many people can be blindly wrong about something. So just roll with it,
listen to every advice, ignore most of it[^1]. It is not a coincidence that the best
decisions of life come from there.
