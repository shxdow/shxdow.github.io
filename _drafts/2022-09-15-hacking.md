The hacking community has always been built upon intellectual curiosity,
knowledge sharing and the desire of pushing the boundaries of what is

often falls short in the systematization of knowledge, leading to treating
memory corruption exploitation as a folkloristic discipline, passed informally
from one another, rather than a body of knowledge existing on its own.
