# Reasons that personally stop me from blogging

- I have nothing new to say
- I believe it's a waste of everyones time to write about things that have already been said
- I fundamentally misunderstand the point of saying something more than two or three times

[Secondary research](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_research) might be the answer to all three.
