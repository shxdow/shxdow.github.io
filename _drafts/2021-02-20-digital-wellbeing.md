This post grows out of some thoughts that have been sparked by being overloaded by job 
requirements in the midst of the first break out of the virus in Italy. To make
things simpler, I'm based in Bergamo a city that as you may know has been hit by
the virus in a way that I would have never thought would have been this close in
my life. COVID aside, which is not what is meant to be discussed here, at least
not wholeheartedly, one of the problems that we face in modern society is the
lack of a true disconnection from stimulus. Of all kinds.

<!-- Introduction -->
<!--   - COVID, overwork -->
<!--   - man was not constantly connected -->
<!--   - man had used to solve problems physically -->
<!-- Solution -->
<!--   - one of the two can be solved with a few tweaks in ones devices -->
<!--   - mindfulness -->
<!--   - exercise -->
