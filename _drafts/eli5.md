# Statistics

## Hypothesis Testing (incomplete)
_On the problem of inference/induction_

Suppose that I wanted to figure out whether an hypothesis of mine was true or not, namely, whether all swans
are 75% white. Suppose that an acquaintance of mine comes with a Swan that is 30% white. _Does my hypothesis
hold ?_ This is where it gets tricky, how can I tell whether my guess was reasonable ? The way staticians solved
the problem was by stating that if the swan your acquaintance brings is _much_ different (different beyond an arbitrarly
choosen threshold) than mine than it is reasonable to refute my initial hypothesis.

## Monte Carlo simulation

Let's assume, on a normal work weekday, that I came to work late. 
For the sake of the story, let's imagine that my boss didn't like
employees late on their first day on the job. Since he's (where "he"
is a fictional character I have yet to invent) trained in quantitative
methods, decides to take a careful look at the path I took this moring
to figure out whether he's dealing with a chronically late person, or 
it just happend by chance. He fires up his favourite map application
and finds out how much traffic there is on avarage and its variance.
Because the path and its charateristics are known, he is able to 
to artificially create an environment that reproduces the path in a similiar
enough way that he can infere what is statisticallly likely to happen
