The hacking community has always been built upon intellectual curiosity,
knowledge sharing and the desire of pushing the boundaries of what is
currently possible.  

Despite these tenants, or perhaps becasue of them, it often falls short in the
systematization of knowledge.  

Consequentially it being treated as a folkloristic discipline, passed
informally from one another, rather than a body of knowledge existing on its
own.  

I strive to be different.
