# Hi!

I am completing my M.Sc. in computer
engineering whilst working in security.

I'm interested in browsers, operatings systems, virtual machines,
compilers, program analysis, decentralised systems,
software reverse engineering and typography.  

I occasionally write about the aforementioned topics on my [blog](/blog).
