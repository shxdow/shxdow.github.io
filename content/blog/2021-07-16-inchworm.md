An inchworm is a small animal that crawls by pulling
its back part of body towards his front part to then
extend his front one forward.  
Such movement pattern can be used as a mental model
to think about progress in all sorts of suits in life.  
  
Improving at fundamentals (i.e. lower end of the worm)
serves a solid basis upon which the most advanced skills
need to be built.  
Unfortunately, the sole increase in
one's skill ceiling does translate directly into
improvement for two reasons more or less interwinded.  
First, assuming a gaussian distribution, the mean
performance is the most impactful aspect long term
as it is what is mostly likely to take place and as
such is the one that should be optimized against.  
Second, the benefits of a strong A game are nullified
by the worst games taking place an equal amount of
times (due to symmetric probabilities a gaussian
curve).  
  
This theory looks to me as a specific instance of the
inversion principle, the one by which it can be
easier to solve the complementary version of a
problem instead of canonical one.
