# Hi! I'm Alpha.

I am completing my M.Sc. in engineering whilst working in computer security.

I like compilers, reverse engineering, vulnerability research, logic and mathematics. Even to my surprise, I managed to get interested enough in weightlifting make it a part of my daily life.

I occasionally write about things I'm learning on my [blog](/blog).
