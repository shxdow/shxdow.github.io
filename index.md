# Hi! I'm Alpha.

I am completing my M.Sc. in computer engineering whilst 
working in security research.  

I like binary exploitation, program analysis,
logic,  compilers, emulation and reverse
engineering. Even to my surprise, I managed to
get interested enough in various forms of physical
exerices to make them a part of my daily life. I
// do a lot of other stuff in the little free time I have.

I occasionally write about things I'm learning on my
[blog](/blog).  
If you'd like to buy me tea (sorry, I don't drink coffe)
you can drop a [donation](https://ko-fi.com/shxdow).

I'm phasing out my usage of [Twitter](https://twitter.com/shxdowtc) so
feel free to reach me out at
[@imshxdow:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/@imshxdow:matrix.org)
or
