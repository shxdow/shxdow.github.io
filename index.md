# Hi! I'm Alpha.

I am completing my M.Sc. in computer engineering whilst 
working in security.  

I like binary exploitation, program analysis,
logic, compilers, emulation and reverse
engineering. I do a lot of other stuff in the little free time I have.

I occasionally write about things that interest me on my [blog](/blog).  

I'm phasing out my usage of [Twitter](https://twitter.com/shxdowtc) so
follow me on 
[@shxdow@treehouse.systems](https://social.treehouse.systems/@shxdow).
and feel free to reach me out at
[@imshxdow:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/@imshxdow:matrix.org)

These are things I've done at some point:
