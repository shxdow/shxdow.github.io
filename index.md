# Hi! I'm Alpha.

_I'm considering (remote) offers in vulnerability research, if interested reach out via email (website footer)._  

I am completing my M.Sc. in computer engineering whilst working in
computer security.  

I like vulnerability research, binary {exploitation, analysis}, logic and
mathematics, compilers, reverse engineering. Even to my surprise, I managed to
get interested enough in weightlifting to make it a part of my daily life.

I occasionally write about things I'm learning on my
[blog](/blog).  
If you'd like to buy me tea (sorry, I don't drink coffe)
you can drop a [donation](https://ko-fi.com/shxdow).
