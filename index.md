# Hi! I'm Alpha.

I am completing my M.Sc. in computer engineering whilst working in
computer security.

I like compilers, reverse engineering, vulnerability
research, logic and mathematics. Even to my surprise, I
managed to get interested enough in weightlifting to make
it a part of my daily life.

I occasionally write about things I'm learning on my
[blog](/blog).  
If you'd like to buy me a tea (sorry, I don't drink coffe)
you can drop a donation on [ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/shxdow)
