# Hi!

I am completing my M.Sc. in computer
engineering whilst working in security.

I like browsers, operatings systems,
compilers, mathematics, program
analysis, emulation and reverse
engineering. I like to keep myself busy
hence I do a lot of other stuff in the
little free time I have.

I occasionally write about things that
interest me on my [blog](/blog).

You can find me on 
[@shxdow@treehouse.systems](https://social.treehouse.systems/@shxdow)
and 
[@imshxdow:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/@imshxdow:matrix.org).
