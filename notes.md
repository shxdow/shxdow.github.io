This page is heavily inspired from [gwern.net/notes](https://www.gwern.net/Notes), it is a collection of things I found interesting enough to store somewhere

> Half the challenge of fighting procrastination is the pain of starting—I find when
I actually get into the swing of working on even dull tasks, it’s not so bad. 
So this suggests a solution: never start. Merely have perpetual drafts, 
which one tweaks from time to time. And the rest takes care of itself.

<!-- # Statistics -->
<!--  -->
<!-- It is an understatement to say that I was left unsatisfied by the stats course I took in university. -->
<!-- I since made it my goal to properly go over statistics making an effort to properly learn the discipline. -->
<!-- The following notes are mostly taken from [Professor Knudson' s youtube videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdxWrq0zBgPW0554eqyaR_jYMJ1ux5MgI) -->
<!--  -->
<!-- ### Probability Groundwork -->
<!--  -->
<!-- #### Experiment: -->
<!--  -->
<!-- Any procedure that: -->
<!--  -->
<!-- 1. can be repeated (theoretically) $\infty$ many times -->
<!-- 2. has a well-defined set of possible outcomes   -->
<!--  -->
<!-- _eg_:  -->
<!-- Given $4$ red and $6$ brown M&Ms, choose $1$, record color, and put it back -->
<!--  -->
<!-- #### Sample space: -->
<!--  -->
<!-- Set of all possible outcomes, denoted $S$ -->
<!--  -->
<!-- #### Sample outcome -->
<!--  -->
<!-- One possible outcome, an element -->
<!-- $$ -->
<!-- s \in S -->
<!-- $$ -->
<!--  -->
<!-- _eg_: flip a coin two times: -->
<!--  -->
<!-- $$ -->
<!-- S = \{ HH, HT, TH, TT \} -->
<!-- $$   -->
<!-- or   -->
<!-- $$S = \{HH, HT, TT\}$$ if order does not matter   -->
<!-- one sample otucome is 2 tails $(TT)$ -->

If I reacall correctly, this is close to what Paul Graham calls a good heuristic to identify interesting problems

> "When you are overloaded, don't think of it as not having enough time; think of it as having too much to do. You can't give yourself more time, but you can give yourself less to do, at least for the moment." ~ [@KentBeck](https://twitter.com/kentbeck) and [@martinfowler](https://twitter.com/martinfowler)

> "A very useful heuristic, a potent filter:  When someone criticizes you, train to immediately ask yourself:  "Would I rather be him/her, or I'd rather be me?" before taking the remark at face value." - Nassim Nicholas Taleb

[^1]: Needless to say, tools that are hard to reason about do play their role. But it goes much much further than that. Producing secure software is _really_ hard.
[^2]: Even though such results are indeed obtained by standing on the shoulders of giants they are still very impressive nonetheless
