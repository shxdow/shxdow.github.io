This page is heavily inspired from [gwern.net/notes](www.gwern.net/Notes), it is a collection of things I found interesting enough to store somewhere

### Software Engineering

_Why is software engineering such a mess compared to other engineering disciplines ?_

One of the first things I thought about is its very immaterial nature:
computer systems are far less limited in the growth of their complexity 
compared to the physical ones that have characterized engineering as 
a whole for centuries. Such over-linear growth has systematically 
made our systems grow in their complexity at a much faster rate at 
which we comprehend them. Computer security is the epitome of such
phenomena as security vulnerabilities are all about [^1] leveraging
broken assumptions and deeper understanding of the underlying system.

> Infosec is all about the mismatch between our intuition and the actual behavior of the systems we build. That makes it harmful to study the field as an abstract, isolated domain. To truly master it, dive into how computers work, then make a habit of asking yourself "okay, but what if assumption X does not hold true?" every step along the way. _~ lcamtuf_

<!-- - Fundamental limits of computation (Limits of Turing machines, Incompleteness theorems) -->
<!-- - Very heterogeneous backgrounds among practitioners (This is both a pro and a con) -->

[^1]: Needless to say, primitive and hard to reason about tools do play their role
