  <strong>About this blog</strong><br>
</div><br>
  <p>This site is more of a chance I give to myself to collect my thoughts
  on a variety of topics on low level aspects of computer science and security
  and expand my knowledge while doing so. As such
  operating systems, binary exploitation and reverse engineering are going to be
  the main focus of my writing. In regards to the content, there is no logical
  reason for which the reader should even slightly trust what I say,
  he / she is infact invited to be highly critical of it.
