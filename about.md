<!-- ### FAQ -->
<!--  -->
<!-- [[**First Design**<img src="/assets/img/firstdesign.jpg"/>::lmn]]Why is the website structured the way it is? -->
<!--  -->
<!-- {:.boxit} -->
<!-- > The design of the website is inspired by multiple sources with the intention of making the website more functional. Having said that, I am not a skilled front-end developer/UI-developer, so I could only come somewhat closer to my inital design that I sketched *(see left or click on this &#8853; icon beside the question above if you are on a mobile device)*, hopefully this will clear why it's structured the way it is. In fact, I had to remove the lab option because of my current inability to design it. That said, I can also safely say that I am improving based on the initial iterations of the website that can be seen here: [[Jan-22-2020::https://web.archive.org/web/20200122164405/raghuveer.net]], [[Apr-13-2020::https://web.archive.org/web/20200413193808/raghuveer.net]], [[Apr-20-2020::https://web.archive.org/web/20200420172058/raghuveer.net]]   -->
