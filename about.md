Hi!  
I'm a studying computer engineering at the University of Bergamo and working as a penetration tester.   
My interests are reverse engineering, system internals, binary exploitation, distributed systems, compilers,
kernels, science, mathematics and too many other things to list here.

## About the website

This website was initially born out of a desire to share various bits of my work and eventually
started becoming a digital verions of my notes, a peek inside various portions of my world. The
theme I'm currently using is <author>, as it allows to easily insert text in margins. When writing,
reading, thinking, my thoughts tend to follow a very non-linear path which I felt is best expressed
by adding meta content.
